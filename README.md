# Matplotlib Header

Simple matplotlib header for making your plots more visual pleasing.
Similarly to [https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib](prettyplotlib).
Difference is this is really just a `.py` file you import, that changes some of the default values of matplotlib.
Nothing fancy.

This is based on [http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html](matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html).


# Font Choice

Most journals want either sans-serif or specifically Arial/Helvetica.

# Color Choice

I dislike the default colors in matplotlib (who doesn't), so I changed them to some colors which are still clear, but doesn't make you vomit.

# Examples

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
