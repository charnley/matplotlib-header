# Matplotlib Header

Simple matplotlib header for making your plots more visual pleasing.
Alot like [https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib](prettyplotlib).
Difference is this is really just a `.py` file you import, that changes some of the default values of matplotlib.
Nothing fancy.

This is based on [http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html](matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html).
