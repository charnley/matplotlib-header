# Matplotlib Header

Simple matplotlib header for making your plots more visual pleasing.
Similarly to [https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib](prettyplotlib).
Difference is this is really just a `.py` file you import, that changes some of the default values of matplotlib.
Nothing fancy.

This is based on [http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html](matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html).


## Font Choice

Most journals want either sans-serif or specifically Arial/Helvetica.

## Color Choice

I dislike the default colors in matplotlib (who doesn't), so I changed them to some colors which are still clear, but doesn't make you vomit.

## Examples

Description | Default MPL | `mpl_header`
--- | --- | ---
Standard XY plot with some normal distributions | `example_before.png` | `example_after.png`
Another XY plot with some normal distributions | `example_before.png` | `example_after.png`
2D colormap plot | `example_before.png` | `example_after.png`
